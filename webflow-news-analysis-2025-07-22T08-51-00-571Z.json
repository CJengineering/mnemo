      "\n\n\nSUGGESTIONS OR FEEDBACK? HOW J-WAFS SOLUTIONS GRANTS BRING RESEARCH TO MARKET\n\nFor the Abdul Latif Jameel Water and Food Systems Lab (J-WAFS), 2025 marks a decade of translating groundbreaking research into tangible solutions for global challenges. Few examples illustrate that mission better than NONA Technologies. With support from a J-WAFS Solutions grant, MIT electrical engineering and biological engineering Professor Jongyoon Han and his team developed a portable desalination device that transforms seawater into clean drinking water without filters or high-pressure pumps. The device stands apart from traditional systems because conventional desalination technologies, like reverse osmosis, are energy-intensive, prone to fouling, and typically deployed at large, centralized plants. In contrast, the device developed in Han's lab employs ion concentration polarization technology to remove salts and particles from seawater, producing potable water that exceeds World Health Organization standards. It is compact, solar-powered, and operable at the push of a button - making it an ideal solution for off-grid and disaster-stricken areas.\n\nThis research laid the foundation for spinning out NONA Technologies along with co-founders Junghyo Yoon, a former postdoc in Han's lab, and Bruce Crawford MBA '23, to commercialize the technology and address pressing water-scarcity issues worldwide. \"This is really the culmination of a 10-year journey that I and my group have been on,\" said Han in an earlier MIT News article. \"We worked for years on the physics behind individual desalination processes, but pushing all those advances into a box, building a system, and demonstrating it in the ocean ... that was a really meaningful and rewarding experience for me.\" You can watch this video showcasing the device in action.\n\nMoving breakthrough research out of the lab and into the world is a well-known challenge. While traditional \"seed\" grants typically support early-stage research at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 1-2, few funding sources exist to help academic teams navigate to the next phase of technology development. The J-WAFS Solutions Program is strategically designed to address this critical gap by supporting technologies in the high-risk, early-commercialization phase that is often neglected by traditional research, corporate, and venture funding. By supporting technologies at TRLs 3-5, the program increases the likelihood that promising innovations will survive beyond the university setting, advancing sufficiently to attract follow-on funding. Equally important, the program gives academic researchers the time, resources, and flexibility to de-risk their technology, explore customer need and potential real-world applications, and determine whether and how they want to pursue commercialization.\n\nFor faculty-led teams like Han's, the J-WAFS Solutions Program provided the critical financial runway and entrepreneurial guidance needed to refine the technology, test assumptions about market fit, and lay the foundation for a startup team. While still in the MIT innovation ecosystem, NONA secured over £200",
      "\nArts for Health in the Face of Climate Change: Community Jameel x Afikra COP28 Conversations – Episode 2 \n\nIn this live session of the Community Jameel x Afikra COP28 Conversation Series at Jameel Arts Centre, panelists working at the intersection of the arts, health, and climate action explored the important role of art and arts organizations in responding to the climate crisis through the lens of health. The event was held in collaboration with the Jameel Arts Health Lab, a joint effort between Jameel Arts Centre, Nadia Christidi, Uns Kattan, and Dr. Marina Romanello. \n\nNadia Christidi, a researcher, writer, and arts practitioner, is currently a PhD candidate in History, Anthropology, and Science, Technology, and Society at MIT. She has a particular interest in how art, design, and architecture can be utilized in future imagining and planning processes. \n\nUns Kattan, the deputy director and head of research and learning at Art Jameel, has a strong interest in visual culture and alternative histories. For over ten years, she has worked in various capacities including research, programming, and content development. \n\nDr. Marina Romanello, the executive director of the Lancet Countdown and a health researcher at University College London, has a background in clinical biochemistry and biomedical sciences. She is also a member of the working group on health co-benefits in climate change mitigation policies for Italy’s Superior Health Council. \n\nDr. Nisha Sajnani, a founding co-director of the Jameel Arts & Health Lab, established in collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO), New York University (NYU), Community Jameel, and Culturunners, works to improve health and wellbeing through the arts. She is also the director of the program in drama therapy and theatre & health lab, as well as a founding co-director of the Arts & Health @NYU. \n\nStephen Stapleton, an artist, social entrepreneur, and founding director of CULTURUNNERS, is known for developing platforms for cultural exchange with the Middle East. He is also a founding co-director of the Jameel Arts & Health Lab, established in collaboration with the WHO, NYU, Community Jameel, and Culturunners. \n\nCléa Daridan, the senior curator and cultural lead at Community Jameel, is also a senior lecturer at the École Nationale Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs in Paris. \n\nThis series aims to amplify local communities and foster a more inclusive and informed discussion around climate action. It also seeks to build a forum for intergenerational collaboration and engagement, channeling a unique voice and inspiring thoughtful discussions between youth, experts, non-experts, and key global decision-makers. \n\nAbout Our Work: \n\nWe at the Community Jameel x Afikra COP28 Conversations are dedicated to fostering a deeper appreciation for the Arab",
