Backed by the Ivorian government and the French Development Agency, the collaboration will provide training programmes, including a master’s degree and in-service training for civil servants. This collaboration sets the stage for the formal launch of ADEPT (Alliance for Data, Evaluation, and Policy Training) later this year, which will empower individuals and organisations worldwide to innovate, test and scale poverty-fighting policies and programmes. </p><p id=\"\">“ADEPT represents a new vision to scale our capacity building work beyond the limits of what we can achieve alone, creating a global ecosystem of evidence-informed policymaking that will help transform how decisions are made and improve countless lives,\" said <a href=\"/people/esther-duflo\" id=\"\">Esther Duflo</a>, co-founder and co-director of J-PAL, about the initiative.<br><br><a href=\"/team/george-richards\" id=\"\">George Richards</a>, director of Community Jameel, said: “ADEPT is a powerful new way for J-PAL to massively scale up its support for the worldwide movement of researchers and practitioners working to alleviate poverty through scientific evidence. With the need to expand this work as great as ever—in the face of climate change, conflict and other challenges—Community Jameel is supporting J-PAL to launch ADEPT later this year, and we are excited to see the ground laid for an ADEPT programme in Côte d’Ivoire.” </p>",
